# Phase 3: Feature Implementation & Integration

## Scope
Implement and integrate Features 3/5/6, focusing on synergies (e.g., standards enhancing search/dashboard/integration). Builds on Phase 2 MVP to a feature-rich version with full teacher workflows. Includes testing for quantified improvements.

## Deliverables
- Integrated Features 3/5/6.
- Synergy tests (e.g., standards in search).
- Updated 'after' instance with all 6 features.

## Tasks/Features
### Feature 3: Advanced Search and Filtering
1. Enhance Portal Catalog with faceted indexes.
2. Integrate standards-based filtering (from Feature 2).
3. Create Volto search component.
4. Optimize for mobile (Feature 4).
5. Test with bin/test and user-flow.md.

### Feature 5: Dashboard/Analytics Functionality
1. Create Volto blocks for metrics (portal_catalog queries).
2. Incorporate standards coverage analysis (Feature 2).
3. Add engagement views.
4. Ensure responsive display (Feature 4).
5. Test integration/no-breakage.

### Feature 6: Google Classroom Integration
1. Install API client add-on.
2. Extend content types with metadata (standards from Feature 2).
3. Implement sync action in Volto.
4. Secure with auth (Feature 1).
5. Test full sync and verify workflows.

### Task 1: Synergy and Testing
1. Test interconnections (e.g., standards in search/dashboard/sync).
2. Run comprehensive bin/test.
3. Quantify improvements (e.g., time benchmarks).
4. Update 'edu-plone' branch.
5. Compare with 'original-plone'.

## Impacted Files and Directories
- **Directories**: src/plone_addon/rest/ (API), src/volto-addon/blocks/ (dashboard/search), tests/ (expanded).
- **Files**: src/plone_addon/rest/search_serializer.py, src/volto-addon/components/search.jsx (Feature 3); src/volto-addon/blocks/analytics_block.jsx, src/volto-addon/reducers/metrics.js (Feature 5); src/plone_addon/rest/google_sync.py, src/volto-addon/actions/sync_action.js (Feature 6); configure.zcml (regs); tests/test_synergies.py (tests).
- **Reasons**: Features extend APIs/components; tests verify synergies.

**Review Checklist**:
- Verify each feature works in isolation.
- Test synergies (e.g., standards filtering).
- Run bin/test with coverage.
- Benchmark metrics.
- Commit and compare branches.

## Rules Adherence
- Use ZCA for extensions; follow project-rules.md naming.
- Preserve core: Modular add-ons only.
- Align with ui-rules.md (e.g., responsive).

## Iteration Notes
Delivers feature-rich app; sets up for Phase 4 polish.
