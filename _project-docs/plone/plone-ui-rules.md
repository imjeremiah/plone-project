# UI Design Principles for Volto Frontend

This document defines the core UI design principles for the Volto React frontend of the Plone-based Educational Content Platform. Principles are derived from the application's architecture (component-based ZCA, Volto blocks), user journeys (cyclical flows emphasizing discovery and interaction), and tech stack (React, Redux, Semantic UI). They ensure consistency, accessibility, and modularity across features, focusing on K-12 teacher workflows without breaking core Plone functionality.

## 1. Modularity and Component Reusability
- **Description**: Build UIs using reusable React components and Volto blocks for drag-and-drop composition.
- **Rationale**: Derived from ZCA (interfaces, adapters) and Volto's blocks system; supports synergies like standards tagging across search/dashboard.
- **Application**: Use Redux for state management; register custom blocks for features (e.g., standards alignment widget reusable in editing/search).
- **Best Practices**: Shadow components for overrides; avoid monolithic pages—favor composable blocks.

## 2. Accessibility-First Design
- **Description**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and screen reader optimization.
- **Rationale**: Core Plone characteristic; user flows emphasize end-user viewing (e.g., responsive discovery).
- **Application**: Apply ARIA labels in Volto components; test with tools like Lighthouse for all journeys (e.g., search results navigable by keyboard).
- **Best Practices**: Use Semantic UI's accessible elements; provide alt text for blocks/images.

## 3. Responsiveness and Mobile Optimization
- **Description**: Design for cross-device use with responsive layouts (mobile-first via Volto customizations).
- **Rationale**: From tech stack (Semantic UI, PostCSS) and user flows (e.g., tablet-optimized lesson planning).
- **Application**: Ensure features like dashboard/analytics and search adapt to screens; integrate with standards alignment for on-the-go tagging.
- **Best Practices**: Use media queries in CSS Modules; test on emulators for teacher workflows.

## 4. User-Centric and Cyclical Flows
- **Description**: Prioritize intuitive navigation with cyclical journeys (e.g., search → view → edit → publish → analyze).
- **Rationale**: Based on user flows (cyclical segments) and synergies (e.g., standards linking features).
- **Application**: Implement breadcrumbs/routers in Volto; ensure seamless transitions (e.g., from dashboard metrics to search).
- **Best Practices**: Use React Router for navigation; provide feedback (e.g., loading states in Redux).

## 5. Internationalization and Localization
- **Description**: Support multilingual interfaces with RTL and timezone handling.
- **Rationale**: Plone core feature; flows include multilingual content management.
- **Application**: Use React Intl for strings; integrate with standards alignment for localized tagging.
- **Best Practices**: Extract messages for translation; test RTL in Volto themes.

## 6. Security and Permission-Aware UI
- **Description**: Reflect role-based permissions in UI (e.g., hide edit options for viewers).
- **Rationale**: From security system (PAS, permissions) and flows (role-based access).
- **Application**: Query plone.restapi for permissions; disable features dynamically (e.g., sync button only for authorized users).
- **Best Practices**: Handle CSRF in forms; use conditional rendering in React.

## 7. Performance and Optimization
- **Description**: Optimize for fast loads with caching and efficient queries.
- **Rationale**: Tech stack (plone.memoize, MVCC in ZODB); flows involve search/indexing.
- **Application**: Use Redux selectors for memoization; batch API calls in features like analytics.
- **Best Practices**: Implement code splitting in Webpack; monitor with Volto debug tools.

These principles guide UI development, ensuring alignment with Volto's stack and teacher-focused journeys while preserving Plone's modularity.
