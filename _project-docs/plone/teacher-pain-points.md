## 🎯 Teacher Profile & Context

### Primary User: K-12 Classroom Teachers
- **Technology Comfort**: Varies from basic to intermediate

## 🚫 Critical Pain Points

### 1. **Interface Complexity & Learning Curve**

**Issue**: Overwhelming toolbar and navigation complexity
```
Problem: 15+ toolbar buttons, nested menus, technical jargon
Teacher Quote: "I just want to add a lesson plan, why are there so many buttons?"
```

**Specific Challenges**:
- **Toolbar Overload**: Edit bar contains advanced technical options (sharing, workflow, portlets)
- **Menu Depth**: Content creation buried in "Add new..." dropdown
- **Technical Language**: Terms like "workflow", "portlets", "ZMI" confuse educators
- **Cognitive Load**: Too many options presented simultaneously

**Impact**: 🔴 **High** - Teachers abandon content creation or require extensive training

### 2. **Content Creation Workflow Friction**

**Issue**: Multi-step, form-heavy content creation process
```
Current Flow: Add Menu → Document → 20+ Form Fields → Technical Settings → Save
Desired Flow: Quick Create → Title & Content → Publish
```

**Specific Pain Points**:
- **Form Complexity**: 20+ fields including technical metadata (creators, rights, versioning)
- **Required Fields**: Unclear which fields are mandatory vs. optional
- **Blocks vs. Rich Text**: Confusing dual editing modes (classic text + blocks)
- **Save vs. Publish**: Workflow states unclear to non-technical users

**Impact**: 🔴 **High** - 5-10 minute task becomes 20+ minutes with confusion

### 3. **Mobile & Responsive Design Issues**

**Issue**: Poor mobile/tablet experience for on-the-go teachers
```
Problem: Desktop-centric interface doesn't adapt well to touch devices
```

**Specific Issues**:
- **Touch Targets**: Toolbar buttons too small for finger navigation
- **Text Input**: Rich text editor difficult on mobile keyboards
- **Content Preview**: Can't easily preview how content appears to students
- **Offline Capability**: No offline editing support

**Impact**: 🟡 **Medium** - Limits flexibility for modern teaching workflows

### 4. **Content Organization & Navigation**

**Issue**: Folder-based hierarchy doesn't match teaching mental models
```
Teacher Mental Model: Subject → Grade → Unit → Lesson
Current System: Generic folders with no educational context
```

**Pain Points**:
- **No Subject/Grade Organization**: Generic folder structure
- **Search Limitations**: Basic text search, no standards-based filtering
- **Content Relationships**: Can't easily link related lessons or prerequisites
- **Bulk Operations**: Difficult to manage multiple lessons simultaneously

**Impact**: 🟡 **Medium** - Teachers create workaround filing systems

### 5. **Standards Alignment Workflow**

**Issue**: No built-in educational standards integration
```
Current: Manual tagging in generic "Tags" field
Needed: Dedicated Common Core, state standards alignment
```

**Challenges**:
- **Manual Entry**: Teachers must type standard codes manually
- **No Validation**: Incorrect or outdated standards references
- **No Suggestions**: No autocomplete for standards alignment
- **Reporting Gaps**: Can't generate standards coverage reports

**Impact**: 🔴 **High** - Critical for educational compliance and planning

### 6. **Collaboration & Sharing Limitations**

**Issue**: Complex permission model doesn't support teaching team workflows
```
Teacher Need: "Share with my grade-level team but not other teachers"
Current System: Technical role-based permissions requiring admin intervention
```

**Problems**:
- **Permission Complexity**: Manager/Editor/Contributor roles don't match school hierarchies
- **Sharing Workflow**: Multi-step process to share content with colleagues
- **Student Access**: No easy way to control student visibility
- **Parent Communication**: No parent portal integration

**Impact**: 🟡 **Medium** - Reduces collaborative teaching effectiveness
