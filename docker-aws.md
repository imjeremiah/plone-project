Below is a detailed guide on how to containerize Plone using Docker and deploy it to AWS, fully aligned with the @project-brief.md. This approach directly supports the brief's "Modernization Opportunities" (e.g., lines 26-30: "Modern container deployment with Docker/Kubernetes", "API-first architecture replacing monolithic structure", and "Python 3.11+ migration with async/await patterns"). It fits into the 7-Day Project Timeline, particularly Days 3-4 (Modernization Design & Foundation: "Implement modern deployment pipeline (containerization, CI/CD, cloud deployment)"), and can boost your scores in Legacy System Understanding (by preserving Plone's core logic in containers), Technical Implementation Quality (efficient, secure cloud setup), and overall success (shipping a relaunch-ready app).

Using Docker containerizes Plone for portability and scalability, while AWS provides cloud hosting (e.g., via ECS for managed containers or EC2 for simplicity). This evolves the legacy monolithic structure toward a modern, API-first setup (e.g., using Plone's plone.restapi for headless mode). I'll build on your local checklist.md setup—assume you've got Plone running locally first (as in that file), then Dockerize and deploy.

### Prerequisites
- **Local Plone Setup**: Complete the checklist.md to have a working local instance (e.g., in ~/plone-project). This ensures you can test before containerizing.
- **Docker Installed**: On macOS, install via Homebrew (`brew install --cask docker`) or download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Verify: `docker --version`.
- **AWS Account**: Sign up at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) (free tier available). Install AWS CLI: `brew install awscli`, then configure with `aws configure` (enter your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region e.g., us-east-1).
- **GitHub Repo**: If you forked/cloned Plone as in checklist.md, use that for your Dockerfile.

### Step 1: Dockerize Plone (Containerization)
Plone has official Docker support ([docs.plone.org](https://docs.plone.org/manage/docker/)), making this straightforward. We'll create a custom Dockerfile based on the official Plone image, incorporating Python 3.11+ for async/await.

1. **Navigate to Your Project**: `cd ~/plone-project` (from checklist.md).
2. **Create a Dockerfile**: In the root (where buildout.cfg is), create `Dockerfile` with this content (customized for Plone 6.1):
   ```
   # Use official Plone base image with Python 3.11
   FROM plone/plone-backend:6.1-python311

   # Set working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy your local Plone config/buildout files (for customizations)
   COPY . /app

   # Install build dependencies and run buildout
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
       build-essential \
       libjpeg-dev \
       libxml2-dev \
       libxslt1-dev \
       zlib1g-dev \
       git \
       && pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel zc.buildout \
       && buildout \
       && apt-get purge -y --auto-remove build-essential \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

   # Expose Plone's default port
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Run Plone in foreground
   ENTRYPOINT ["bin/instance"]
   CMD ["fg"]
   ```
   - This uses the official Plone Docker image from [hub.docker.com/r/plone/plone-backend](https://hub.docker.com/r/plone/plone-backend), ensuring Python 3.11+.
   - It copies your local files (e.g., custom configs) and runs buildout inside the container.

3. **Build the Docker Image**: `docker build -t my-plone-app:latest .` (takes 5-15 minutes first time).
4. **Run Locally for Testing**: `docker run -p 8080:8080 my-plone-app:latest`.
   - Access at http://localhost:8080 (create site as in checklist.md Step 6).
   - Verify: Test core features (e.g., add content, API calls). This confirms containerization preserves Plone's business logic while enabling modern deployment.

5. **Push to Registry (for AWS)**: Tag and push to Docker Hub or AWS ECR.
   - Create ECR repo: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-plone-repo`.
   - Authenticate: `aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.
   - Tag: `docker tag my-plone-app:latest <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-plone-repo:latest`.
   - Push: `docker push <your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-plone-repo:latest`.

This step aligns with the brief's containerization goal—quantify in your docs (e.g., "Reduced setup time by 50% via Docker").

### Step 2: Deploy to AWS (Cloud Hosting)
For simplicity, use AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) for managed Docker orchestration—it's serverless and scales easily. (Alternative: EC2 for a VM-like setup if you prefer; see notes below.)

1. **Set Up ECS Cluster**:
   - In AWS Console ([console.aws.amazon.com/ecs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs)), create a cluster: Choose "Fargate" (serverless) > Name it "plone-cluster" > Create.
   - Create a Task Definition: JSON mode, paste something like:
     ```
     {
       "family": "plone-task",
       "networkMode": "awsvpc",
       "containerDefinitions": [
         {
           "name": "plone-container",
           "image": "<your-account-id>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-plone-repo:latest",
           "portMappings": [{ "containerPort": 8080, "hostPort": 8080 }],
           "essential": true,
           "memory": 512,
           "cpu": 256
         }
       ],
       "requiresCompatibilities": ["FARGATE"],
       "cpu": "256",
       "memory": "512"
     }
     ```
     - Register it.

2. **Create a Service**:
   - In the cluster, create a service: Use the task definition > Set replicas to 1 > VPC/subnets (default or create) > Security group (allow inbound TCP 8080 from your IP).
   - Launch; wait 2-5 minutes.

3. **Access and Test**:
   - Get public IP/URL from ECS tasks (or add Load Balancer for production: Create ALB in EC2, target port 8080).
   - Visit http://<ecs-public-ip>:8080, create site, and test (e.g., API endpoints for headless mode).
   - For persistence: Mount an EFS volume in the task definition for the /data folder (Plone's ZODB).

4. **CI/CD Pipeline (Optional for Brief's Deployment Pipeline)**:
   - Use AWS CodePipeline: Connect to your GitHub fork > Build with CodeBuild (using buildspec.yml for `docker build`) > Deploy to ECS.
   - This demonstrates full modernization—document it for AI Utilization points.

**Alternative: Simpler EC2 Deployment** (If ECS Feels Complex):
- Launch EC2 instance (t3.micro, Ubuntu AMI).
- SSH in, install Docker (`sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io`).
- Pull/run your image: `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-plone-app:latest`.
- Access via instance public IP.

### Tie-In to @project-brief.md
- **Grading Boost**: This shows "Excellent" Technical Implementation (efficient queries, security via AWS IAM/ECR), Feature Integration (e.g., deploy with new API endpoints), and AI Utilization (use tools like Cursor to generate Dockerfile or AWS configs). For Target User (e.g., Educational Platform), emphasize cloud scalability for collaborative features.
- **Timeline Fit**: Do this in Days 3-4 after local mastery (Days 1-2). In Day 7, demo before/after (local legacy vs. AWS-modernized).
- **Costs**: Free tier covers basics (e.g., ECS Fargate ~$0.04/hour); monitor via AWS Billing.
- **Resources**: Official Plone Docker docs ([docs.plone.org](https://docs.plone.org/manage/docker/)); AWS ECS guide ([aws.amazon.com/ecs](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/getting-started/)).
