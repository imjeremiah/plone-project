# Educational Content Platform Modernization Project

## Introduction

In the professional software development world, developers often inherit massive, complex legacy codebases rather than building from scratch. This project adapts the enterprise legacy modernization scenario by selecting Plone CMS—a mature, open-source content management system with over 1.1 million lines of code originally rooted in older Python versions (2.7/3.6)—and evolving it into a specialized Educational Content Platform for a new target market: K-12 teachers.

Using Plone 6.1 as the base (evolving from its legacy foundations while incorporating modernizations like Python 3.11+), we'll leverage AI-assisted tools such as Cursor for code exploration, generation, and debugging to understand, preserve, and enhance the system's core business logic (e.g., content workflows, user management, and integrations). This results in a relaunch-ready application that demonstrates the ability to transform legacy systems for contemporary needs, directly translating to enterprise value by unlocking embedded business logic for educational collaboration.

## Core Challenge

Modernize Plone CMS (1.1M+ lines) by identifying K-12 teachers as the target user segment, then use AI-assisted development to create a relaunch-ready Educational Content Platform. This preserves Plone's core business logic (e.g., hierarchical content storage in ZODB, permissions, and workflows) while delivering a modern user experience and architecture, including API-first design and cloud deployment.

**Success means:** Shipping a working, containerized application deployed to AWS, with a before/after demonstration quantifying improvements (e.g., reduced planning time by 40%), showcasing deep legacy understanding and AI-driven transformation.

## Project Pathway

**Legacy Codebase:** Plone CMS (1.1M lines, using version 6.1 as the evolutionary base from Python 2.7/3.6 roots, justified by its retention of legacy patterns while enabling modern extensions).

**Why This System:** Plone contains years of web application patterns, user management systems, content workflows, and integration logic that represent typical enterprise Python deployments, making it ideal for adaptation to educational needs like collaborative lesson planning.

**Modernization Opportunities:**
- Python 3.11+ migration with async/await patterns (implemented via local setup and feature code).
- Modern container deployment with Docker (local testing and AWS integration).
- API-first architecture replacing monolithic structure (using plone.restapi for headless features).
- Modern frontend frameworks replacing server-side templates (customizing Volto for responsive, React-based UI).

## Target User Selection

Based on the pathway, the target user segment is K-12 teachers (grades 6-12) in U.S. public schools, particularly in under-resourced districts, who need a centralized platform for collaborative lesson planning integrated with cloud tools like Google Classroom.

### Examples of Target Users (Adapted):
- **Plone → Educational Content Platform:** Teachers needing collaborative lesson planning with Google Classroom integration for assignments and real-time sharing.

### Target User Requirements:
- Represents a legitimate market opportunity: The edtech market ($250B+ by 2025) has demand for free, open-source tools bridging fragmented systems; 70% of teachers use Google Classroom, but lack centralized hubs, wasting ~10 hours/week on admin.
- Highlights specific pain points solved by modern technology: Fragmented tools (solved by integrations), limited collaboration (solved by real-time features and responsive design), security/access issues (solved by enhanced auth and workflows), and lack of cloud scalability (solved by Docker/AWS deployment).
- Narrow enough for 7 days (focus on 2-3 workflows like lesson creation/sharing) but broad enough for meaningful modernization (demonstrates value for 1M+ U.S. teachers via quantifiable improvements).

## Grading Criteria

The project will target the highest scores by adhering to the criteria, with specific strategies:

### 1. Legacy System Understanding (Target: 18-20 points)
Demonstrates deep comprehension of Plone's original codebase through architecture mapping (e.g., ZODB flows, ZCA components) via AI-assisted exploration, identifying critical logic like workflows to preserve in features.

### 2. Six New Features Implementation (Target: 50 points - 10 points each)
Add exactly 6 meaningful features that enhance Plone for teachers, each functional, value-adding, and integrated via ZCA/Volto without breaking core functionality.

**Feature Requirements:** Each integrates with existing code (e.g., REST API, event system) and is tested for completeness.

**Specific Features (Tied to Brief Examples):**
- Modern authentication (OAuth/2FA/SSO with Google): Secure login preserving Plone's acl_users.
- Real-time notifications/messaging: WebSockets for updates, hooked into events.
- Advanced search and filtering: Elasticsearch supplement to Catalog for lesson queries.
- Mobile-responsive design improvements: Volto customizations for device-friendly UX.
- Dashboard/analytics functionality: Volto blocks showing engagement metrics via portal_catalog.
- Integration with third-party services: Google Classroom sync using API client, extending content types.

**Scoring Strategy:** Aim for "Excellent" by quantifying value (e.g., "Reduces search time by 75%") and ensuring integration (e.g., unit tests via bin/test).

### 3. Technical Implementation Quality (Target: 17-20 points)
Code follows best practices (e.g., PEP 8, error handling in async code), with efficient queries, security (e.g., OAuth), and Docker/AWS deployment for performance. Quantify: E.g., "Load times reduced by 40% post-modernization."

### 4. AI Utilization Documentation (Target: 9-10 points)
Comprehensive logging in ai-usage.md, with 50+ prompts/techniques categorized by phase, innovative uses (e.g., AI-generated safe extensions), and methodology (iterative prompting for no-breakage assurance).

## 7-Day Project Timeline

### Days 1-2: Legacy System Mastery
- Complete checklist.md setup for local Plone 6.1 instance.
- Analyze architecture using AI-assisted exploration (e.g., Cursor prompts for workflows, ZCA mapping).
- Define teacher segment needs/pain points (e.g., fragmentation via Google tools).
- Map core logic (e.g., content types as "lessons") to preserve.
- Reproduce base functionality (test core features "as is").

### Days 3-4: Modernization Design & Foundation
- Design architecture: API-first with Volto, preserving logic while adding extensions.
- Implement deployment pipeline: Dockerize locally, deploy to AWS ECS (free tier) for relaunch-ready app.
- Set up Volto project (via npm) and link to backend.
- Begin core workflows (e.g., lesson planning UI foundation).

### Days 5-6: Feature Implementation & Integration
- Implement/test 6 features (3 per day), ensuring no breakage via modular add-ons and bin/test.
- Add Google integrations (OAuth/Classroom sync) with free API credentials.
- Optimize/perform tests for quantified improvements (e.g., benchmarks).
- Update ai-usage.md with prompts (e.g., for code gen/debugging).

### Day 7: Polish & Launch Preparation
- Final testing/bug fixes for production-ready quality.
- Create deployment docs (e.g., Docker/AWS guide) and user migration notes (e.g., from base to featured app).
- Prepare before/after demo: Side-by-side videos/screenshots with metrics (e.g., task time reductions).
- Finalize ai-usage.md and overall methodology (e.g., how AI enabled evolution).

## Final Thoughts

This project bridges academic concepts with professional reality by evolving Plone 6.1 into an Educational Content Platform, preserving its legacy strengths (e.g., robust workflows) for teachers' collaborative needs. By sticking with 6.1, focusing on straightforward Docker/AWS deployment, and leveraging AI for safe, innovative features, we demonstrate the ability to transform complex systems competitively.

Success here proves we can take a legacy codebase, understand its value, and relaunch it for new opportunities like edtech, directly relevant to career growth. **Remember:** The goal is to evolve Plone's embedded value for teachers, using modern tools without judging the original system. All decisions (e.g., no legacy fork, quantified demo) ensure a thorough, high-scoring outcome within 7 days.
